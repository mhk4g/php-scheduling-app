Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):

I implemented two extra credit features: a page for registering new maker accounts
and the use of SHA256 encrypted passwords for makers, allowing for password reset 
via an emailed link to a security question. The security question is created during
maker registration and its answer is also stored in encrypted form.
